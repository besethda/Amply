      <h3 class="title">What's gone wrong with streaming?</h3>
      <p class="text">
        If you’re a working musician, you know how tough it is to earn from your
        art.<br />
        Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud — they’re great for exposure, but
        terrible for income. Most artists earn fractions of a cent per stream.
        Unless you’re Bruno Mars, streaming alone won’t pay your bills.
      </p>
      <div class="intro">
        <h3 class="title">...Introducing Amply</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text">
        Amply isn’t another streaming service.<br />
        It’s a hosting and payment platform that lets artists decide how much
        their streams are worth. You upload your music, set your per-stream
        price, and Amply automatically charges listeners based on their play
        activity. You keep full control and full profit.
      </p>
      <div class="intro">
        <h3 class="title">How does it work??</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text">
        Spotify pays out about 70% of its revenue on artist royalties, yet most
        artists get almost nothing. Amply changes that by not having royalties.
        We simply host your music using the same cloud infrastructure (AWS) that
        powers Spotify, giving you high-quality global streaming at a fraction
        of the cost. Listeners pay directly for what they hear, not for bloated
        subscription plans.<br />
        The average listener spends about 114 minutes a day on music — roughly
        3,500 streams per month. At $0.004 per stream, that’s around $4.50, less
        than half of a typical $12 Spotify subscription. With Amply, artists
        earn more, and listeners pay less.
      </p>
      <div class="intro">
        <h3 class="title">
          How is Amply different from a streaming platform??
        </h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text">
        Good question! A streaming platform hosts copyrighted content and
        distributes it. Amply does not host anything itself, it merely acts as
        an interface for artists to use their own hosting and streaming
        services. Amply also does not manage payments, they go directly between
        the user and artist. When it comes to royalties, Amply does not have
        royalties since artists control their content prices and distribution.
